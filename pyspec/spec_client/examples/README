This a set of examples to show some of the features of the
SpecClient module and how to integrate within a python/Qt4 graphical application

For other graphical toolkits simply remember to implement a method to regularly
update events coming from spec. In the examples a QTimer is used to call
the function "update_spec_events()". 

Spec server protocol is described in detail in :
    http://www.certif.com/spec_help/server.html
In particular see the full list of properties that you can subscribe to in that document.

All examples use the application "fourc".
(if you want to connect to another spec application you will just need to change it in the example file)

You must start "fourc" with the "-S" option

  bash% fourc -S

Then run the examples by simply typing
   python <example.py>

example_qt_variable.py
   Setting a variable and receiving updates. 

example_qt_motor.py  
   Motor example with "chi" motor in "fourc"
   Shows state and position updates

example_qt_command.py  
   Shows how to send a simple macro "wa" and how to send a macro function with
   arguments and retrieve its return value. 
   The example uses the following macro function definition in "spec":

      def hello(name) '{
          retstr = sprintf("Hello %s", name)
          print retstr
          return retstr
      }'

example_qt_status.py  
   Shows how to check for connection status and ready/busy status.  
   The connection to ready/busy channel illustrate also how to connect to any
   arbitrary spec property
  
   A button "Quit" shows how to interrupt a running macro or command in spec.
