DESCRIPTION
+++++++++++

The **pyspec** python module is a set of utilities to provide features
around the **spec** software package by CSS.

The **pyspec** python module can run with python2.7 and any python3 installation.

**pyspec** has been tested on the main *Linux* distributions where
**spec** is installed.  

**pyspec** can run also on MacOS 

Windows support is not yet tested but it should, in theory, work to open
**spec** files or access **spec** remotely via the **spec** server feature.

**pyspec** requires the *numpy* to be installed to provide some of the
features.
